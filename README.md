# React Begin

**React Begin** is a beginner-friendly project built using React and Vite. It helps you understand how to create and use components, write JSX, handle JavaScript in JSX, and apply basic interactivity to your app.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project contains:

- A `Greeting` component that displays a welcome message.
- A `Button` component that shows an alert when hovered.
- An `App` component that renders both components.

This simple setup introduces the core features of React development.

## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Covered

### âœ… Writing Your First Component

In React, a component is a reusable block of UI. You define it using a JavaScript function that returns JSX (markup). In this project, the `Greeting` and `Button` components are examples of functional components.

Example:
```jsx
const Greeting = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, Sharada!</h1>;
};
âœ… Importing and Exporting Components
To keep code organized, components are placed in separate files. You can use export default to export a component, and import to include it in another file.

Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
// In Greeting.jsx
export default Greeting;

// In App.jsx
import Greeting from './Greeting';
âœ… Writing Markup with JSX
JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript. It makes it easy to describe what the UI should look like.

Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
return (
  <button>Click me!</button>
);
This looks like HTML but is actually JSX. JSX is then compiled into regular JavaScript by React.

âœ… JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces
You can include JavaScript expressions inside JSX by using curly braces {}. This is useful for inserting dynamic content, calling functions, or using variables.

Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
const name = "Sharada";
return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
In this case, {name} is replaced with the value of the name variable when rendering the UI.


ðŸ”„ How to Run the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
npm run dev
Then visit http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

ðŸŽ¯ Output
Heading: Hello, Sharada!

Button: Click me! (shows alert when hovered)
